                        I was looking at old photos of us the other day, and I realized something. The times i spent with you were the best. It's in the way you laugh, the way you make fun of me the way we just vibed so much it was the cutest.

                        Even when we are apart, you are the first thing I think of when I wake up. It's annoying actually, how much space you take up in my brain. But I wouldn't have it any other way.

                        It feels quiet without you. Too quiet. I miss your texts popping up on my phone. I miss sending you stupid reels. I miss the way you smell.

                        Honestly? Everything reminds me of you. The songs on the radio, the food I eat, the places I walk past. You are haunting me in the most beautiful way possible.
